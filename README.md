# detecting-exoplanets
Detected the size and mass of exoplanets using multiple images and the transit and radial velocity methods.

Using multiple images of the same part of space, I used Python in order to measure the size and mass of different exoplanets. I was able to detect and measure the size of exoplanets using light curves according to the transit of the exoplanet in front of a star through AstroImage J. I used the radial velocity method in order to find the mass of the exoplanet, finding the phase according to the doppler shift of the star. Using a set of equations including the phase and Kepler's 3rd law to determine the mass.
